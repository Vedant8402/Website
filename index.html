      <h1>How to Train Your Dragon</h1>

        The first movie in the HTTYD trilogy was released March 26, 2010. Following this movie, 2 shows and 2 more movies would be released with the last film in 2019 marking the end of this decade long trilogy.

        In an online movie summary, it states: "In Earth's future, a global crop
        blight and second Dust Bowl are slowly rendering the planet
        uninhabitable. Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a brilliant NASA
        physicist, is working on plans to save mankind by transporting Earth's
        population to a new home via a wormhole. But first, Brand must send
        former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and a team of researchers
        through the wormhole and across the galaxy to find out which of three
        planets could be mankind's new home."

        I find the movie to be much more than just this summary, but I can't
        spoil it, and that's something you need to figure out on your own.

        The movie stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, David Gyasi, and Wes
        Bentley as the 4 main astronauts embarking on the mission to search for
        a new planet to call home. The cast works great together (for their time
        onscreen) and the flow is unmatched. These are all very skilled actors,
        even while some may have more movie background than others.
